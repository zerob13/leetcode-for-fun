## 🌟 Introduction

This project started as a way to document my journey through LeetCode. It's a space where I can experiment with different algorithms, data structures, and programming languages. While the primary focus is on JavaScript (ES6+), you'll also find solutions in other languages like Java and Shell.

The main goal is to have fun while coding and to create a valuable resource for myself and others who are on a similar learning path.

## ✨ Features

*   **Multi-Language Solutions:** Code examples in JavaScript, Java, and Shell.
*   **Modern JavaScript:** Utilizes ES6+ features, with Babel for transpilation.
*   **Clean Code:** ESLint is used to maintain a consistent and clean codebase.
*   **Well-Organized:** Solutions are structured by language and problem number.
*   **Open Source:** Licensed under the MIT license, free for everyone to use and learn from.
